You are given two single linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Example:

Input: (1 -> 4 -> 3) + (2 -> 6 -> 1)
Output: 3 -> 0 -> 5
Explanation: 341 + 162 = 503

Input: (1 -> 3) + (2 -> 6 -> 0)
Output: 3 -> 9 -> 0
Explanation: 31 + 062 = 093
